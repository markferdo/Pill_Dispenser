# Pill_Dispenser
### Automated system that calibrates and dispenses pills in certain intervals
## ğŸ’» Technologies and Tools Used:
ğŸ’ Opto fork sensor (Configured as an input with pull-up resistor)
###
ğŸ’ Piezo sensor (Configured as an input with pull-up resistor)
### 
ğŸ’ Stepper motor
### 
ğŸ’ EEPROM
### 
ğŸ’ I2C protocol
### 
ğŸ’ LED
### 
ğŸ’ Buttons
## ğŸ’¡ Key Features of the Device:
###  
ğŸ’  The device remembers its state even if the power goes off.
### 
ğŸ’  After powering back on, it continues from where it stopped. 
### 
ğŸ’  If power is lost during dispensing, it recalibrates automatically without dispensing the pills. 
## How the device works: 
### ğŸ’  Calibration process
The calibration process starts when the opto-fork is triggered. Following the trigger, the motor will run 2 full cycles to get the average steps per revolution. Once the system has the average steps, it can dispense pills. We have three main functions for this purpose: motor running, calibration, and run function. These three functions are responsible for energizing the motor, calibrating it, and then dispensing the pills.
